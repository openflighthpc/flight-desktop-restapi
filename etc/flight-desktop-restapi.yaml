# Refresh Rates
# There are two refresh rates which are used to control how frequently the
# available desktops are checked and verified.
#
# The available desktops are checked frequently according to the
# 'short_refresh_rate'. This will only detect desktops which have been
# previously verified.
#
# All the desktops will be verified less frequently approximately according to
# the 'refresh_rate'. This may run slightly more frequently than expected unless
# 'refresh_rate' is a whole-interval of 'short_refresh_rate'.
#
# NOTE: As the avail/verify checks run periodically, a timeout is used to
# ensure they run at regular intervals. This timeout is determined from the
# "short_refresh_rate". Therefore the "short_refresh_rate" must be sufficiently
# long to allow for all the desktops to be "verified". The "short_refresh_rate"
# must also be less than or equal to the "refresh_rate".
#
# The environment variables flight_DESKTOP_RESTAPI_refresh_rate and
# flight_DESKTOP_RESTAPI_short_refresh_rate takes precedence.

# short_refresh_rate: 3600
# refresh_rate: 3600
